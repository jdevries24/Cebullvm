Welcome to the Cebu fork of LLVM
this is a project to modify LLVM and the clang toolchain to
allow compiling assembling and linking for the JRISC architecture.

Currently a work in progress on the JRISCdev target. When the code
Is stable a new target JRISC will be added to allow for use of the LLVM 
Toolchain for the JRISC system
